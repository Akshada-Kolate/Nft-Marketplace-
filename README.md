# Coding a NFT marketplace

## What is this repo about?
- Learn to code smart contract that compiles with ERC-721 standard in Solidity.
- Practice Solidity in real project after finishing all basic course on [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/)
- Frontend design is not the focus of this project.

## What did I learn?
- Understand why ERC721 standard is written this way by coding the interface and contracts myself.
- Writing automated test with `Truffle`, to test smart contract before deploying on a blockchain.
- Connect frontend to MetaMask wallet.
- Connect frontend to deployed blockchain (local test environment).
- How to mint an NFT on frontend.
